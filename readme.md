# Timug Static Page Generator

It has been created for personal blog creation purpose. Timus has its limits, but it fulfills the purposes for which it was created.

Works with jinja2 template engine. And also, yaml front matter used to determinate spesific definitions. That can be renderable or order of the menu. It does not support to many features but basic features are good enough for many users.

Default template is based on Tailwind CSS and it requires nodejs on the deployment system.
It is still underdevelopment. It will take time to write more information about features, functions, and configuration files details.
